*Blockchain Mode:*  
Connect your wallet to explore campaigns, each with a heartfelt story—like a stray cat needing surgery or a shelter expansion. Click “Donate Now” to view details, including photos, progress, and blockchain transparency. Your donation is securely ]done.

*Non-Blockchain Mode:*  
Choose a campaign and donate via traditional methods. Campaign details, including impact metrics, are shared transparently, and you’ll receive an email confirmation of your contribution.
With your wallet/payment method connected, you explore ongoing campaigns. Each campaign card tells a story—a stray dog needing surgery or a shelter aiming to expand. Clicking **“Donate Now”** takes you deeper, showing photos, progress bars, and exactly how your donation will help. A few clicks, and your transaction is securely recorded on the blockchain.
